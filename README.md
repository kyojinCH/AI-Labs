# AI-Labs
Contained within this repository are several projects related to Natural Language Processing (NLP), Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN), N-Grams, and Recommendation Systems.

# NLP
NLP, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence, focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to process, understand, and generate human language. Within my NLP lab, I explore various techniques such as text preprocessing, text classification, sentiment analysis, and language generation. I utilize popular NLP libraries such as NLTK, SpaCy, and Gensim to implement these techniques.

# FFNN
FFNN, or multilayer perceptrons (MLP), represent a prevalent type of neural network architecture. Comprising an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer, FFNNs hold a wide range of applications. Within my FFNN lab, I implement various architectures of FFNNs, including single-layer perceptrons, multilayer perceptrons, and deep neural networks. To accomplish this, I rely on established deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.

# N-Grams
N-Grams refer to contiguous sequences of N items extracted from a given sequence of text or speech. These sequences find extensive use in natural language processing applications, including language modeling, text classification, and sentiment analysis. Within my N-Grams lab, I explore various techniques such as unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and higher order n-grams, utilizing established libraries such as NLTK, Gensim, and Scikit-Learn.

# Recommendation Systems
Recommendation Systems comprise a common type of AI system that provides suggestions for items to users. These systems find wide use in e-commerce, social media, and content streaming platforms. In my Recommendation Systems lab, I investigate various techniques such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid filtering, employing prominent libraries such as Surprise and LightFM.

# Lab Reports
In addition to the project code, detailed lab reports have been included that provide comprehensive descriptions of the IT and Math theory applied in each project. These reports offer an in-depth explanation of the concepts and techniques employed and provide a step-by-step guide for implementing them.

The goal of this repository is to offer a comprehensive learning experience for individuals interested in AI, NLP, FFNN, N-Grams, and Recommendation Systems. The inclusion of the lab reports aims to facilitate a better understanding of the theoretical aspects behind each project and assist users in applying these concepts to their own work.

It is recommended that users refer to these lab reports before exploring the project code to obtain a solid foundation of the underlying theory and enhance comprehension of the code. It is worth noting that many references to relevant math papers are cited in these reports. If further details are required, please do not hesitate to contact me.

I hope you find these projects informative and useful. Please feel free to contact me with any questions or suggestions. Thank you for your interest in my repository.
